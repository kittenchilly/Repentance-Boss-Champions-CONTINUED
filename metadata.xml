    <description>[h1] This mod requires REPENTOGON to work! [/h1]

The original mod now ported to REPENTOGON for bug fixes and better mod compatibility! Perhaps even more in the future...?

This mod adds [b]36 new champion variants[/b] to the many bosses added in Repentance. These champions seek to emulate the vanilla game - keeping the bosses similar, but changing, removing, or adding just enough to make the fight a unique experience.
